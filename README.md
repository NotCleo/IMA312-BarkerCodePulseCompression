To execute the project;

Team : 

    Mukund Rathi (2023BEC0051)
    Amruth Ayaan Gulawani (2023BEC0050)
    Ritishaa Anand (2023BEC0014)

The Repository Contains : 

    Origianl Paper PDF (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6676251)
    Our Report PDF 
    Our Presentation PPT PDF
    GNU Radio grc file
    MATLAB .m file 

To run the project (without cloning) :

    Download the "barkercodesupdated.grc" file and run it in, this generates two .dat files ; "transmit.dat" and "receive.dat"
    Download the "demo_matlab.m" file and run it in offline MATLAB with the path for "transmit.dat" and "receive.dat" ; this generates the neccessary graphs
